# DataPuller
Gathers data about the current map you are playing to then be sent out over a websocket for other software to use, e.g. A web overlay like [BSDP-Overlay](../BSDP-Overlay). This mod works with multi PC setups!

## Installation:
To install this mod, download the [latest version](./releases/latest) and place the `DataPuller.dll` into your mods folder. Make sure to also have any of the dependencies listed below installed too.

## Project status:
This project is still maintianed though loosely, I will keep updating it to make sure it remains compatiable with the game but don't expect new features to constantly be added.  
For a detailed view on the project status, check the [TODO](./.todo) file.

## Developer documentation:
### Obtaining the data via the Websocket:
Data is broadcasted over an unsecure websocket (plain `ws`) that runs on port `2946`, the path to the data is `/BSDataPuller/<TYPE>`.  
The reason for the use of an unsecure websocket is because it is pratically impossible to get a verified and signed SSL certificate for redistribution, that would break the whole point of SSL.  
Each endpoint will send out a JSON object, check [Data Types](#data-types) for the specific data that each endpoint sends out.

### Obtaining the data via the C#:
It is possible to use the data that this mod exposes within your own mod if you wish to do so.  
To get started, add the [latest version](./releases/latest) of the mod to your project as a reference.  
Data types can be accessed within the `DataPuller.Data` namespace.  
All data types extend the `AData` class which contains an `OnUpdate` event that can be subscribed to that is fired whenever the data is updated.  
Check [Data Types](#data-types) for the specific data that each endpoint sends out.

### Data types:
I will format each entry in the following way:
```
<TYPE>
	<DESCRIPTION>
	<LOCATION>
	<OBJECT>
		///<COMMENT>
		<TYPE> <NAME> = <DEFAULT_VALUE>;
```
All data types contain the following properties:
```cs
///The time that the data was serialized.
long UnixTimestamp;
```
Below is a list of all the specific data types:
<details>
<summary style="font-weight: 600">MapData</summary>
